# Library
A simple library, built to demonstrate mastery of 
databases and server management.

# Features
Allowes a user to create, edit, and delete files 
to a library.

# Findings
The reason for this project is to create my first full stack app that is functional.
I've learned a lot from this project, and will use this to tackle a much larger and 
more challenging full stack application next.
